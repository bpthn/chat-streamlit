# iChatOSHC: iLab Capstone Project
Our project attempts to close the gap between international students and the healthcare services they require. By utilising data-driven insights, we hope to establish a platform that gives valuable knowledge, facilitates access to health care, and provides support that suits the needs of international students.

This project aims to address common issues faced by international students, such as language hurdles, unfamiliar healthcare systems, and the OSHC insurance requirement for visa approval. We intend to empower students to make informed decisions regarding their health and well-being by utilising innovative solutions and a user-friendly interface.

There are three main features in this project:
1. Disease Diagnosis with Infermedica API
2. OSHC Q&A chatbot
3. Pharmacy Location finding

## Business understanding

The Department of Home Affairs requires overseas students in Australia to get Overseas Student Health pay (OSHC) to help pay medical expenditures. This provision intends to safeguard students from significant medical bills while also reducing the load on the Australian health system (Department of Health, 2022).

International education makes a significant contribution to Australia's economy. It was the country's largest service export in the 2019-20 fiscal year, accounting for $37.5 billion. Over 4 million overseas students registered in Australian colleges in 2023, up 23.04% from 2022, indicating a strong recovery after the disruptions caused by the global epidemic. Consistent expansion indicates a high demand for Australia's educational opportunities.

## Recommendations and next steps
1. The disease diagnosis capability is currently restricted to a command-line interface, limiting user access. To improve this, we intend to incorporate this component into our online application, resulting in a more intuitive and usable interface.
2. The chatbot only provides information on OSHC insurance from two major suppliers, Bupa and Medibank, which may not fulfil the needs of all international students. Our future plans include expanding this to include more insurance carriers, giving students a broader range of options for healthcare coverage.
3. The online application is intended for users with basic English skills. To improve accessibility for non-English users, we want to introduce multilingual support. This will enable students with diverse linguistic backgrounds to properly use the chatbot and obtain critical information and services.
